global thresholding is effective for images with obvious two-peak histograms. however, for images with nonuniform illumination, these kind of methods tend to give non-satisfactory results. As such, local or even adaptive thresholding methods are imployed in such cases. 
In this project, one is given the sample image, nonuniform_illumination.bmp, which is presented in the lecturing ppt for demonstrating adaptive thresholding, the image is divided into 4x4 sub-blocks, each sub-block takes the same size (125x100, as the sample image is 500x400 in dimension). compute variance for each sub-block, and for sub-blocks with variance larger than 100, a threshold is calculated separatively, while for the remaining sub-blocks, they are taken as a whole, and only one threshold is calculated. 
The threshold should be calculated by the iterative threshold determination method (two-means thresholding method).
A proto-type python script is provided, with some function prototypes are defined. 
Both the implemented py files, and the resulting binarized image should be submitted for this project. The resulting binarized image should be named as bin_nonuniform_illumination.bmp
